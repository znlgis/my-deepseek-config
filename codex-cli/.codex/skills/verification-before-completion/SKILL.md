# Verification Before Completion

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it
passes.

## The Gate Function

Before claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. **IDENTIFY**: What command proves this claim?
2. **RUN**: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. **READ**: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. **VERIFY**: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. Only then: make the claim

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
[Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
NOT: "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Build:**
```
[Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
NOT: "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
Re-read plan -> Create checklist -> Verify each -> Report gaps or completion
NOT: "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
Agent reports success -> Check VCS diff -> Verify changes -> Report actual state
NOT: Trust agent report
```

## When To Apply

ALWAYS before:

- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents
